<H1>Shopify Mobile Developer Internship Question</H1>

<H2>Problem</H2>
You're a successful Shopify merchant! Your inventory has grown so much that you can't keep track of them with your fingers anymore. Create a mobile app that displays a list of all the products your store sells. You want to quickly glance at them, so the list should also have the following:

<ul>
  <li>The product image (just use the first image in the result, if there are any)</li>
  <li>The title of the product.</li>
  <li>The description of the product.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><p>&#10004; The first page of products with the image, title, and description.</p></li>
    <li><p>&#10004; A simple video of your app scrolling through the list up and down</p></li>
    <ol><p>If you chose to add any of the extra challenges, also include a video of those solutions.</li></ol>
    <li><p>&#10004; Your project code.</p></li>
</ol>
