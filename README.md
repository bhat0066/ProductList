### Problem:
You're a successful Shopify merchant! Your inventory has grown so much that you can't keep track of them with your fingers anymore. Create a mobile app that displays a list of all the products your store sells. You want to quickly glance at them, so the list should also have the following:

<ul>
  <li>The product image (just use the first image in the result, if there are any)</li>
  <li>The title of the product.</li>
  <li>The description of the product.</li>
</ul>

### Demo:
-------
This is the sample app in action:

 ### TODO:

- [x] The first page of products with the image, title, and description.
- [x] A simple video of your app scrolling through the list up and down.
- [ ] Extra Challenges
  - [x] Product Details Page
  - [ ] Search Bar
